Azure Confidential Compute
===========================

Setting up an SGX instance
----------------------------

Secure-Signer has been developed and tested on Microsoft Azure. The goal of this guide is to expedite setting up your own Azure server. Stay tuned for more information on setting up Secure-Signer at home or on other cloud providers.

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_1.png

Select ``Create a resource``.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_2.png

Select ``Create`` to start setting up a VM.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_3.png

Ensure that the Image is set to ``Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS -x64 Gen2``.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_4.png

Select a VM size from the ``DC-Series``. The smallest (and cheapest) VM with 4 GiB of RAM is sufficient to run Secure-Signer; however, it is recommended to use a larger VM if you plan to run the execution client and consensus client on this server. For this demo, we will use Secure-Signer as a truly remote-signing tool and choose the 4 GiB VM (our execution client and consensus client will be run externally on a different server).

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_5.png

Set SSH credentials according to your needs. In this case we will generate a new SSH private key called ``Secure-Signer-key`` that we can use to sign into this server.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_6.png

Add any additional configurations that fit your needs. Then select ``Review and Create``. Verify the OS image and VM size are correct. Then ``Create`` the VM.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_7.png

Securely store the SSH private key, for example in the ``~/.ssh/`` directory.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_8.png

Once deployment finishes, select ``Go to resource``.

------------

Increasing VM disk space
------------------------------

> This is optional if Secure-Signer is being used as a standalone remote-signing tool. If you plan to run the consensus client and execution client on this same VM, we recommend following these steps to increase the size of the disk.

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_9.png

To adjust the disk size, first stop the VM.


.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_10.png

Select ``Stop``

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_11.png

Confirm ``Yes`` and wait for confirmation that is has been stopped. 

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_12.png

Navigate to the ``Disks`` tabs on under ``Settings`` on the left-hand side.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_13.png

Select your ``Disk name`` in this case ``Secure-Signer_OsDisk_1_04e04e...``

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_14.png

Select ``Size + performance`` under ``Settings`` on the left-hand side.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_15.png

Select a disk size and click ``Save``. In this case, a 1024 GiB disk is sufficient to store the required state for the execution client.

------------

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_16.png


.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_17.png

Navigate back to the overview page and ``Start`` the VM again.

------------

In a terminal run the following, substituting your server’s IP and the path to your SSH private key: 

.. code-block:: shell

    ssh -i <path_to_ssh_key> ss@XX.XX.XXX.XXX

.. image:: ../_static/img/azure_18.png

Congratulations! At this point you are ready to proceed to the [next section](../installation) to install the dependencies for Secure-Signer.

SSH Tunneling to Secure-Signer
--------------------------------

It’s possible to run Secure-Signer on the remote Azure server while running your consensus client and execution client locally. Assuming Secure-Signer is installed following the [these steps](../installation) and it is running on port 9003, you can SSH tunnel by running: 

.. code-block:: shell

    ssh -i <path_to_ssh_key> -N -L 9003:localhost:9003 ss@XX.XX.XXX.XXX
